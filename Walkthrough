# Dinobotics Portfolio Build Walkthrough

We have successfully rebuilt the Dinobotics React portfolio and verified the output locally. The site features a comprehensive dark theme, beautiful gradients, structured sections, and interactive project cards.

## Changes Made
- Created a fresh Vite React project inside the `portfolio-site` directory.
- Installed necessary dependencies: `lucide-react`, `framer-motion`, and Tailwind CSS (v4).
- Configured Vite with the `@tailwindcss/vite` plugin to ensure the styles are parsed correctly.
- Replaced the default React component with your provided `DinoboticsPortfolio` component.
- Restarted the local development server at `http://localhost:5173/`.

## Verification Results
The site was verified multiple times to ensure the styling successfully loaded. Once the Tailwind configurations were resolved, the layout, navbar, headings, buttons, and skill cards displayed exactly as intended.

Here is a recording of the final successful build:
